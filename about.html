    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My Name is Annika Fourie. I was born in Limpopo, South Africa on the 13th of May 2001 on Mother’s Day. I spent the first 4 years of my life living on a game farm in Bella Bella. I grew up around many different cultures and religions and most importantly, wildlife. My mother would sometimes come home with a baby animal that had been left behind or injured so we would take it in and raise it or nurse it back to health. She taught me to be compassionate, kind and gentle to the world around me. My father taught me to be brave, and adventurous and to have fun. My parents had me young, their lives had only just started.
      They have always given everything they have to make sure I would thrive. The relationship I have with my parents is not only of family but also of friendship, an everlasting one. I wouldn’t have it any other way</p>

    <p>While I don't remember it well, I never wanted a baby brother, I wanted a baby sister and I made sure that the world knew it. As luck would have it, I ended up with a wild and amazing little brother. He made me see the world from a different perspective and I would and will protect him with everything I've got. No matter how much he annoys me. He was unfortunately born with a Cleft Palate and the first few years of his life were challenging, not that he ever let that stop him. Growing up with a little brother who had a disability of sorts, is what sparked my interest in early childhood development. When my little cousin who has a case of autism came into the picture, it became a passion to understand how they develop and the influences the world around them has on their development.</p>

    <p>We moved to Botswana, Maun by the time I was 5. Life in Maun is very different. It's a small 3rd world country. We didn't grow up going to the mall or to the movies, we grew up going to the bush for the weekend and meeting new people every day as they passed through. We swam in the river while the adults were on the lookout for crocodiles and slept under the stars when we went to the salt pans. There were elephants in town and snakes sneaking into the house. Growing up in a place like this, magic and adventure are always waiting around the corner. So moving back to South Africa years later came as quite a shock to my system. But we are nothing if not adaptable to change.</p>

    <p>I am still trying to figure out what my purpose in life is and where I want to go. Some days I wonder how it's even possible to know who I'm supposed to be, what I'm supposed to do or where I need to be. But I have faith that what is meant to be will be, everything happens for a reason. I believe that fate and the universe will take me where I need to be when I need to be there. After all, hope and faith are what make us human. </p>
